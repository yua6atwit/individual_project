# Employee Satisfaction Data Analysis

## Introduction
Employee satifaction involves the content an employee feels in their work and is important for organizations and employers. It is difficult to maintain employee retention as employees are less likely to stay in a company if they aren't satisfied with their work. The objective of this project is to determine what factors can influence employee satisfaction. This information can be used to improve the work environment, leading to better performance, retention, and productivity from employees. In this project, these factors will be analyized to determine if there is a correlation between these and employee satisfaction.
